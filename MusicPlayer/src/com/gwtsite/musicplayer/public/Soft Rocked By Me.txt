<p>I thought we’d start our evening off with a glass of cold rose 
Then we can sit here on the couch just holding hands 
And I’ll say that you’re beautiful 
You might say I’m moving to fast 
Baby I don’t mind 
Because I know in time </p>

<p>You will be soft rocked by me 
Though it may take some time I know eventually 
You will be soft rocked by me 
I use the passive voice to show how gentle I’ll be 
When I soft rock you 
You will know it’s true 
That you’ve never been soft rocked until you’ve been soft rocked by me </p>

<p>I’ll listen to the things you say about the way you feel 
I’ll smile an understanding smile when your boyfriend calls 
And you’ll go, but you’ll think of me 
And one day you’ll knock on my door 
Because you want to be 
Soft rocked by me </p>

<p>You will be soft rocked by me 
Though it may take some time I know eventually 
You will be soft rocked by me 
I use the passive voice to show how gentle I’ll be 
When I soft rock you 
You will know it’s true 
That you’ve never been soft rocked until you’ve been soft rocked by me </p>

<p>Have you ever been in love with a man who’s sensitive? 
Have you ever spent the night with a man who cries? 
Well that’s me: I’m sensitive 
And I cry, I’m crying right now 
In a manly way 
Because I know someday </p>

<p>You will be soft rocked by me 
Though it may take some time I know eventually 
You will be soft rocked by me 
I use the passive voice to show how gentle I’ll be 
When I soft rock you 
You will know it’s true 
That you’ve never been soft rocked until you’ve been soft rocked by me</p>
