<p>Only a moment ago we had nothing but time 
Everything lasted forever and you were all mine 
Only a dream I know 
Thinking you’d never go 
Tearing off pieces of myself 
Just for the time it buys me </p>

<p>Fold my heart up small 
Or break it into pieces 
Find somewhere and keep it there 
Take it when you go </p>

<p>There in the frame of your face in the cast of your eyes 
I saw this coming but still I am caught by surprise 
All of this time I knew 
That I’d be losing you 
That doesn’t mean that it’s OK 
That doesn’t mean I’m ready </p>

<p>Fold my heart up small 
Or break it into pieces 
Find somewhere and keep it there 
Take it when you go </p>

<p>Some things we always remember, some things we forget 
No way to make it up now no room for regret 
That’s no good for anyone 
And so I come undone 
Now I am less than what I was 
Whatever’s left is yours now </p>

<p>Fold my heart up small 
Or break it into pieces 
Find somewhere and keep it there 
Take it when you go</p>
