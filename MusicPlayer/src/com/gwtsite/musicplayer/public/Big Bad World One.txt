<p>All alone by the table of food in my wrinkled suit and my borrowed tie 
Only thinking of something to say in the moment after the girl walks by 
Everyone else is having fun or else pretending to 
I eat another crudite </p>

<p>I quit, I’m done 
I don’t think it’s gonna work out OK 
It’s no fair and it’s no fun 
If every time it’s gonna end the same way: 
Me zero 
Big bad world one </p>

<p>At the office we’re all having cake cause it’s someone’s birthday I don’t know who 
Get my plate and I’m scanning the room and the only seat is right next to you 
I get the nod, the tiny smile that doesn’t come with teeth 
Maybe you don’t know who I am </p>

<p>I quit, I’m done 
I don’t think it’s gonna work out OK 
It’s no fair and it’s no fun 
If every time it’s gonna end the same way: 
Me zero 
Big bad world one </p>

<p>Staying inside lying in bed 
Noticing something that’s not there 
Follow my heart follow my head 
I’ll follow anything that might get me somewhere </p>

<p>Catch her eye when she’s pouring my coffee and search my head for an opening line 
But I see by the look on her face if I keep my mouth shut I’ll save some time 
What if the best that I can be just isn’t good enough? 
Isn’t it better not to know? </p>

<p>I quit, I’m done 
I don’t think it’s gonna work out OK 
It’s no fair and it’s no fun 
If every time it’s gonna end the same way: 
Me zero 
Big bad world one</p>
