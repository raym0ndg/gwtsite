<p>I like duty 
Let me talk about duty 
Why? Because it needs to get done 
This administration has failed to do it 
And now, we have an urgent duty 
We should do it now 
Do it, and do it well 
If it feels good do it </p>

<p>Yeah, I’m talking about a massive situation 
Let me just...let me just put it to you this way 
The situation could hardly get worse 
And you know how I know? 
I feel this, this terrible sadness 
Is there hope for me? 
Do I have a chance? 
And frankly, do you? </p>

<p>A great duty has been done 
This has required extended duty 
Sometimes duty is hard 
Where there is suffering there is duty 
America’s duty is familiar 
We accept that duty in our time 
We must keep our focus 
We must do our duty 
His purpose is achieved in our duty 
And our duty is fulfilled in service to one another</p>
