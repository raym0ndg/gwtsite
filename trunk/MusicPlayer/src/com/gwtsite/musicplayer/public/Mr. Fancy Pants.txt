<p>Chances are your pants are not as fancy as the pair 
Of very fancy pants that Mr. Fancy Pants will wear 
When everybody’s marching in the fancy pants parade 
He’s gonna pass the test 
He’s gonna be the best 
The best in terms of pants </p>

<p>You look in every catalog you shop at every store 
Cause even though you have a hundred pants you want some more 
When suddenly you see the greatest pants you’ve ever seen 
And even though you know 
It’s gonna cost a lot of dough 
You have to have the world’s best pants </p>

<p>Say a little prayer for Mr. Fancy Pants 
The whole world knows 
They’re only clothes 
And deep inside 
He’s sad </p>

<p>They make the big announcement and the trophy goes to you 
You thought you had some fancy pants and now you know it’s true 
You look at Mr. Fancy Pants and hold the trophy high 
Everybody cheers 
While he’s blinking back the tears 
He doesn’t even have the best pants </p>

<p>Say a little prayer for Mr. Fancy Pants 
It’s all he had 
But don’t feel bad 
He’d do the same 
To you</p>
