<p>Somewhere in the darkness 
There’s a man they call The Skipper fast asleep 
And dreaming of gold 
He wakes before the sun comes 
Even though he’d rather stay in bed 
He curses the cold in Minnesota 
Why’s it always so damn cold 
But he’s got a job to do 
He does it for me and you 
And the red and the white and the blue 
Because he knows he’s got to curl </p>

<p>His team is there and ready 
Though the coffee’s warm, their breath hangs in the air 
They hit the ice 
No one’s there to see it 
There’s no press or paparazzi and that’s OK 
But it’d be nice if someone noticed 
That they’ve all been working hard 
Pushing these rocks around 
Trying to gain some ground 
Got the keep the Canadians down 
And all they got to do is curl </p>

<p>Their lives outside are waiting 
But they give until they’ve given all they have 
They’re dead on their feet 
The Skipper isn’t certain 
But he thinks that maybe this could be the year 
When they defeat the world forever 
And they bring that medal home 
But now it seems years away 
He’s taking it day by day 
When it comes he’ll be ready to play 
That’s why he knows he’s got to curl</p>
