<p>In a town in the woods at the top of a hill 
There’s a house where no one lives 
So you take a big bag of your big city money there and buy it 
Then at night when you’re all alone 
And the house is dark there’s a noise upstairs 
At the top of the stairs there’s a door so you take a deep breath and try it </p>

<p>And the flashlight shines on something moving just inside the door 
There’s a tattered dress and a feeling that you’ve felt somewhere before </p>

<p>And there’s the creepy doll 
That always follows you 
It’s got a ruined eye 
That’s always open </p>

<p>And there’s a creepy doll 
That always follows you 
It’s got a pretty mouth 
To swallow you whole </p>

<p>So you scream and you close the door 
And you tell yourself it was just a dream 
In the morning you head into town cause you want to go antiquing 
In the store there’s a strange old man 
With a wandering eye and a withered hand 
When he hands you the old wooden box you can hear his old bones creaking</p> 

<p>And you know what you will find inside the moment that you see 
That someone carved your name into the tarnished silver key </p>
<p>
And there’s a creepy doll 
That always follows you 
It’s got a ruined eye 
That’s always open </p>

<p>And there’s a creepy doll 
That always follows you 
It’s got a pretty mouth 
To swallow you whole </p>

<p>And when you come home late the doll is waiting up for you 
And when you fix a snack the doll says it would like one too 
The doll is in your house and in your room and in your bed 
The doll is in your eyes and in your arms and in your head and you are crazy </p>

<p>Now it’s late and you head downstairs 
Cause you just can’t sleep and you make some tea 
And the doll disapprovingly asks if you really need that much honey 
You decide that you’ve had enough 
And you lock the doll in the wooden box 
You put the box in the fireplace next to your bag of big city money </p>

<p>As the smoke fills up your tiny room there’s nothing you can do 
And far too late you see the one inside the box is you </p>

<p>And there’s a creepy doll 
That always follows you 
It’s got a ruined eye 
That’s always open </p>

<p>And there’s a creepy doll 
That always follows you 
It’s got a pretty mouth 
To swallow you whole</p>
