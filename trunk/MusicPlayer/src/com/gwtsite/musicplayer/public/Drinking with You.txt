<p>We work late and I pretend that I don’t notice when you’re next to me 
But I do 
I might be mistaken, but I sometimes get the feeling that you notice too 
And I know this place that’s near here 
Quiet dark and small 
When we’re finished here I think that I might want a beer, how about you? 
It’d be nice to go out drinking with you </p>

<p>You would think that we’ve danced around each other long enough to know 
Where we stand 
And my heart stops in a panic when I think how it would feel to finally hold your hand 
We can wait for this to happen 
Or make it happen now 
Either way I think that we should start off with a drink, maybe two 
And it’d be nice to go out drinking with you </p>

<p>No big deal, we can play it nice and cool and keep the pressure off 
Invite our friends 
And we’ll have a few too many, we’ll discreetly share a cab home when the evening ends 
When we reach that awkward moment 
Standing at your door 
We won’t even know cause we’ll just smile and let it go and sail on through
And it’d be nice to go out drinking with you</p>
