<p>Tom Cruise is so in love with Katie 
At least all his people tell him so 
And while he thinks that she’s a very special lady 
It’s probably not the way he’d choose to go 
And a lifetime of longing looks would cause too much distraction 
Good thing that he’s not gay anymore </p>

<p>Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise crazy 
Just be glad it’s him not you 
If you had Tom Cruise’s troubles 
You might be Tom Cruise crazy too 
You’d flash your big white shiny smile 
You’d buy expensive shoes 
But you’d be the only man on Earth 
Who couldn’t enjoy Tom Cruise 
Oh no, you couldn’t enjoy Tom Cruise </p>

<p>Tom Cruise is always getting older 
He knows he’ll never be that young again 
And when Tom Cruise looks back over his shoulder 
He says a thousand younger leading men 
He knows someday he’ll have to play 
An old retarded grandpa 
While someone younger plays his sexy son </p>

You might be Tom Cruise crazy too

You’d buy expensive shoes 
But you’d be the only man on Earth 
Who couldn’t enjoy Tom Cruise 
Oh no, you couldn’t enjoy Tom Cruise </p>

<p>Tom Cruise knows somewhere there’s a place for him 
He’s not of this world anymore... </p>

<p>Somewhere in some secluded castle 
Poor Tom Cruise sits staring at the wall 
And the outside world is always such a hassle 
Sometimes he won’t go out at all 
There are millions who know his name 
Everybody loves him 
Why is it that he feels so alone? </p>
