<p>O’Hare is nice this time of year 
I check my bags and find my seat and buy a beer and settle in 
Such is my life here on the road 
Now my seat back is up, tray table stowed and there’s nothing to do 
I gotta get myself through </p>

<p>So I am shopping in SkyMall 
That five-mile-high mall 
That always has just what I need 
When I get to the gate and remember too late 
I should have brought something to read 
I’m OK, cause I know that I’m gonna shop SkyMall </p>

<p>I bought a pair of bonsai trees 
I bought a big fake rock where I can hide my keys from everyone 
And I imagine what all my friends would say 
To see this lovable Santa dance and sway to my favorite songs 
My favorite holiday songs </p>

<p>And I am shopping in SkyMall 
That five-mile-high mall 
That always has just what I need 
When I get to the gate and remember too late 
I should have brought something to read 
I’m OK, cause I know that I’m gonna shop SkyMall </p>

<p>In Cleveland, I bought a replica of the sword that was broken 
And then somewhere above Detroit some Successories that say “Lead with Vision”</p> 

<p>I love you best when I’m away 
And while I’m out here I look forward to the day when I come home 
Cause there’s something special waiting there 
It’s a whimsical statue of a bear that holds a bottle of wine 
But please don’t touch it, it’s mine </p>

<p>Because I bought it in SkyMall 
That five-mile-high mall 
That always has just what I need 
When I get to the gate and remember too late 
I should have brought something to read 
It’s OK, cause I know that I’m gonna shop SkyMall 
Cause I know that I’m gonna shop SkyMall</p>
