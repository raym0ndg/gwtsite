<p>There’s a small town in the mountains where the streets are wide and still 
There are children making angels in the snow 
The sunset paints the sky at night 
And old man works by candlelight 
A tiny baby smiles and waves hello 
In the cold gray light of dawn an eagle flies 
And the men are happy wearing matching ties </p>

<p>A pair of poodles 
A broken finger will not bend 
Soup with noodles 
A female Klingon’s drunk boyfriend 
A sexy lady 
This party’s better than it seems 
Warren Beatty 
Dear sleeping giant panda: pleasant dreams </p>

<p>A visit to the dentist 
A place to get some pie 
A rainbow floats above a waterfall 
A ferris wheel, a carousel 
The landlord never learned to spell 
Someone put graffiti on the wall 
Atop the Christmas tree, a shining star 
And Dwyer’s rocking out on air guitar </p>

<p>A freight train passes 
Someone’s grandma owns a gun 
A dog with glasses 
A strange balloon man has too much fun 
Thumbs up for Slurpees 
If you’re receiving then you’re not gay 
A case of herpes 
As it turns out the eyepatch is A-OK</p>
