<p>We took the freeway out of town 
We found a place to settle down 
We bought a driveway and a swingset and a dog 
You got your very own bathroom 
I got my very own workshop in the basement </p>

<p>We sit around staring at the wall-to-wall 
Take field trips to our favorite mall 
Waiting for the day when all the kids grow up and leave us here </p>

<p>If you need me 
I’ll be downstairs 
With the shop vac 
You can call but I probably won’t hear you 
Because it’s loud with the shop vac on 
But you’ll be OK 
Cause you’ll be upstairs 
With the TV 
You can cry and I probably won’t hear you 
Because it’s loud with the shop vac on </p>

<p>We hung a flag above the door 
Checked out the gourmet grocery store 
I bought a mower I can ride around the yard 
But we haven’t got real friends 
And now even the fake ones have stopped calling</p> 

<p>Maybe if you forget to hide the keys 
I’ll take a ride to Appleby’s 
I’ll come home drunk on daiquiris and throw up on the neighbor’s lawn </p>

<p>If you need me 
I’ll be downstairs 
With the shop vac 
You can call but I probably won’t hear you 
Because it’s loud with the shop vac on 
But you’ll be OK 
Cause you’ll be upstairs 
With the TV 
You can cry and I probably won’t hear you 
Because it’s loud with the shop vac on </p>

<p>I like the Starbucks here that’s better than the other one 
Cause the other one’s not as good 
They really need to put a light there cause it’s hard to turn 
It’s hard to make a left turn </p>

<p>And when it’s time to go to bed 
I’m still awake inside my head 
I’m floating up above the house and looking down 
I guess I gotta go back there 
I guess there never was any other answer </p>

<p>And as the freeway hums the cars go by 
The headlights roll across the sky 
Many miles away but I can see them speeding through the dark </p>

<p>If you need me 
I’ll be downstairs 
With the shop vac 
You can call but I probably won’t hear you 
Because it’s loud with the shop vac on 
But you’ll be OK 
Cause you’ll be upstairs 
With the TV 
You can cry and I probably won’t hear you 
Because it’s loud with the shop vac on</p>
